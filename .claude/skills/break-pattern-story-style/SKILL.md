  "Break Pattern Story Style": the user's locked style for 100 % motion ads built from a voice-over plus a few
  full-body cut-out photos of the presenter (no talking-head footage), first built for VGC "Break Pattern
  Story" (Oct 2026). Flat neo-paper collage: off-white dot-grid paper, navy/charcoal and one mustard accent from
  the presenter's outfit. The cut-out changes pose per beat beside ink-bordered paper UI cards with hard offset
  shadows, slammed Archivo Black words in strips, JetBrains Mono chips, dense → empty → bright rhythm, a real
  before/after demo and a navy CTA. Silences squeezed to ~0.2 s via one time-map. 9:16, rebuilt for 16:9.
  Use whenever the user says "Break Pattern", "Break Pattern Story",
  "style Break Story", "macam video Break Pattern tu", or asks for a motion ad from cut-out character photos and
  a VO, even without naming it. Built with HyperFrames; renders the real MP4.

# Break Pattern Story Style

First built for VGC **"Break Pattern Story"** (11 Oct 2026). The final is 48.5 s at 9:16 (`1FA VGC Break Story.mp4`), plus a 16:9 rebuild ("Contoh Motion Video Claude Edit 100%").
- **Inputs:** the user's VO, 4 cut-out PNGs of the presenter, the brand's own logo and product screenshots, stills from the user's raw clips, a before/after case-study clip and a supplied song ("the gonk").
- **Feedback that shaped it:** v1 (62 s) was "too slow, long gaps between lines". v2 and v3 squeezed the silences and added camera punches.

What changes per video and what stays locked:
- **Per video:** the VO, the beats, the poses and the product proof.
- **Locked:** the identity below.

Where everything else lives:
- `references/pipeline.md`: the scene catalogue, the VO-squeeze and retime pipeline, the audio recipe and the 16:9 rebuild.
- `template/master/index.master.html`: the exact working master (62.26 s, synced to the un-squeezed VO), recovered and re-verified against the final.
- `template/scripts/`: the rest of the build (`prep_assets.sh`, `edit_vo.py`, `edit_vo_fast.py`, `make_audio_fast.py`, `retime_build.py`, `make_landscape_master.py`, `audit_layout.py`, `sync_plot_fast.py`, `check_levels.py`, `transcribe.py`, `align_edited.py`).
- `template/hf/BRIEF.md` and `template/hf/design.md`: the brief and design spec.

## Locked identity

| Layer | Rule |
|---|---|
| Palette | Paper `#f2eee6` / `#e6e0d2`, ink `#14171f`, navy `#1b2236` / `#252f4a`, charcoal `#171a21`, mustard `#e09827` / `#f0b64a`. **One accent only**, taken from the presenter's outfit, and no neon. Footage and product screenshots keep their true colour |
| Stage | Full-bleed flat backgrounds with a 46 px dot grid (`.bg-paper`, `.bg-navy`, `.bg-char`, `.bg-must`). The background colour flips per beat: navy/charcoal when the work piles up, mustard when the idea lands, paper for explanations |
| Character | Full-body cut-out PNGs with original alpha and a soft drop shadow. **Change the pose per emotion**: shoot (phone selfie), serabut (hands on head), penat (slumped in a chair), presenter (open-palm point). There is often a mustard blob or circle behind them. The character sits at the side, and the content sits on the open side |
| Cards | Neo-paper: 4 px ink border, radius 24, hard `10px 10px 0` ink shadow, and a header bar with chips (`GALERI` / `VIDEO`, `POTONG`, `SUBTITLE CC`, `B-ROLL MP4`, `VISUAL PNG`, `SFX`). Footage cards show real stills from the user's clips with fake `MVI_###.MP4` labels |
| Type | **Archivo Black** uppercase (−0.03 em, line-height .92) for punchlines at ≥ 110 px, in a `.strip` (mustard or ink block with an 8 px offset shadow). **JetBrains Mono 700** uppercase for chips and labels at ≥ 44 px. Ghost words (7 % opacity) sit behind the scene. **No subtitles**: text appears only on punchlines, key points and the CTA |
| Rhythm | Alternate the density: dense (cards piling up) → empty (one clock "3 JAM") → quiet (tired pose, dark) → bright reveal (mustard lockup "VIDEO GUNA CODE", logo on the song drop). No still frame longer than 0.5 s: small "camera punches" on beats, plus ambient drift |
| Motion | Pops use `back.out(1.6–2)` over 0.35–0.45 s, about 20 % faster in the fast cut. Slams use `power4.out` from scale 1.6–2.2. Wipes are a mustard block over 0.35 s. Cards stack with slight random rotations |
| Proof | The real before/after case-study video in a paper card (`SEBELUM` / `SELEPAS · AI`). Keep its original text visible, and play its own sentence inside the demo gap |
| Product | The student's own product screenshots (3 cards) and their own logo files, supplied by them. Never recolour them, and never use another company's logo |
| Ladder | Stair blocks BASIC → ADVANCE → EXPERT on a mustard stage, with the presenter climbing |
| CTA | Navy stage, the VGC wordmark ("edit VIDEO GUNA CODE_"), "KLIK LINK. / DAFTAR / SEKARANG." strips, and a mustard pill "KLIK LINK →" with a cursor tap |
| Audio | VO: silences only are squeezed (between lines 0.20–0.26 s, inside sentences 0.14 s); speech and breaths are untouched. Song: subtle, about 21 dB under the voice, ducked, with a −3 dB dip at 2.2 kHz. Its **drop lands on the logo reveal**. SFX are sparse and synthesised: small pops, slams on punchlines and whooshes only on cuts or wipes. Mix to −14 LUFS, with a true peak of about −1.4 dBFS |

## Workflow

1. **Assets:** run `zsh scripts/prep_assets.sh`, setting `CHAR`, `FOOT`, `CS`, `LOGO_ICON`, `LOGO_WORDMARK` and `CARDS`. Missing logos or cards become neutral placeholders; ask the student for theirs.
2. **VO:**
   1. Run `transcribe.py`, then `edit_vo.py` (a tidy pass: `audio/VO_…_EDITED.wav` and `vo_cues.json`, with the demo gap reserved).
   2. Then run `edit_vo_fast.py`. It squeezes the silences and writes `audio/retime_map.json`, which maps master time to fast time.
   3. Sync visuals to **energy dips**, not Whisper word times.
3. **Master:** edit `master/index.master.html` on the *un-squeezed* timeline. It has scene `<section>`s with data-start/duration, the `T` constants and one GSAP timeline. Rewrite the scenes for the new script, but keep the classes and helpers.
4. **Retime:** `python3 scripts/retime_build.py` writes `hf/index.html`. It remaps every scene, video and tween through the map, so speech stays 1:1 and the gaps shrink.
5. **Audio:** run `make_audio_fast.py` (VO, song with the drop on the logo, SFX through the same map, the case-study sentence), then copy `audio/mix_fast.wav` to `hf/assets/audio/mix.wav`.
6. **Check:**
   1. Run `npx hyperframes check` (contrast must pass; use `data-layout-ignore` on ghost words and `data-layout-allow-overlap` on intended overlaps).
   2. Run `python3 scripts/audit_layout.py`: side margins ≥ 70, key text y 190–1760, no text over the face.
   3. Run `sync_plot_fast.py` and `check_levels.py`.
7. **Render:** `cd hf && npx hyperframes render --quality delivery --fps 30`. Check for black frames, still frames longer than 0.5 s and −14 LUFS.
8. **16:9 (when asked):** run `make_landscape_master.py`, then `retime_build.py master/index.master16.html hf16/index.html`, then `audit_layout.py hf16`. This is a rebuild, not a crop: the character goes at the side, the workflow becomes a 3 + 2 grid, the stairs run left to right, and the demo card sits on the right.

## Break pattern (must)

Don't reuse the last video's beats as-is (gallery → pile → "3 JAM" clock → tired chair → pipeline → stairs). Keep the identity, but pick a new concept angle and a new signature moment per script. See the `feedback-break-pattern-across-videos` memory.

## Known gotchas

- Stop `hyperframes preview --background` before scripted edits, because Studio stamps `data-hf-id` into `index.html`.
- Root-level clips are anchored at 0,0. Position a `<video>` with GSAP x/y, not left/top.
- A second `fromTo` on the same property needs `immediateRender: false`.
- If you edit `hf/index.html` directly (for example in Studio), **don't** run `retime_build.py` afterwards, because it overwrites the file. Make the edit in the master instead.
- Bundled fonts (Archivo Black, JetBrains Mono) need no `@font-face`.
- Run Python with `/usr/bin/python3` (it has numpy, scipy, PIL and pypdf).
- The builder cannot hear the mix. Ask the user to listen once on a phone, especially at the song drop.
