# Storyteller Edu Style

First built for VGC **"Kepada Educators"** (28 Oct 2026). It is a 47.8 s talking-head ad: 45.4 s of A-roll plus a 2.7 s end card.
- 16:9 v2 was approved.
- 9:16 v2 was built from the RAW take.

The editing behaviour comes from a storyteller-explainer reference. Only the behaviour was taken; no reference footage or branding.

What changes per video and what stays locked:
- **Per video:** the script, the beats and the assets.
- **Locked:** the identity below.

Where everything else lives:
- `references/pipeline.md`: numbers, layer order, the beat catalogue and the SFX/mix recipe. Read it before building.
- `template/scripts/`: the exact working build (`build.py` 16:9, `build9.py` 9:16, `audio.py`, `times.py`, prep and finish scripts). It is a worked example, so edit its config and beat blocks rather than writing from scratch.

## Locked identity

| Layer | Rule |
|---|---|
| Structure | Every section follows the same cycle: **chapter card → idea → proof → step**. Each section ends on a visual payoff, never on talk alone |
| Chapter card | Full dark stage `#0F1419` with grain at 7 % overlay. A kicker in **Inter 600, 30 px, letter-spacing .32 em**, with a yellow bold number ("**01** BAYANGKAN"). Below it, one or two huge **Archivo Black** uppercase words (200 px in 16:9), with the key word in yellow `#FFE600`. Glow comes from `text-shadow` only. The card blurs in (blur 18 → 0, scale 1.06 → 1, 0.35 s) and drifts to scale 1.05 over 1.5 s. Hold it about 1.3 s. It is the **only** place a swoosh/whoosh-impact SFX plays |
| Text | **Keywords only, no subtitles.** Archivo Black uppercase with a soft white glow. One yellow word per beat at most. A drop-shadow filter on the parent. Text always goes on the open side of the presenter, never over the face or the jersey print |
| Highlight | Yellow `#FFE600` is the only highlight colour. Lime appears **only on the logo**. Red `#FF5A4F` is used only for ✕ marks |
| Panels | **16:9:** the presenter slides left (x −560, 0.55 s) and the A-roll's right edge feathers through a `--fe` mask variable. A dark panel opens on the right (`rgba(15,20,25,.95)`, radius 30). **9:16:** the presenter glides **down** (y +450…600, sine) with a feathered **top** edge, and the panel sits on top |
| Line diagrams | White 5 px strokes drawn with `strokeDashoffset`, plus nodes that pop in. They are built as the sentence is spoken (tree, ✕ on the wrong branch, a yellow glow on the right one) |
| Slides → video | Real slides drop in as tilted cards. The front slide flies into a video card and becomes the **real** video. The slide then shrinks into the corner as a "**Sebelum**" thumbnail (dark backing). A checklist ticks with yellow dots, video cards push left/right, and a **triptych** (all three) is held **≥ 2.3 s** so people can scan it |
| Metaphor | **Rare.** One light-stage beat (`#E8E6E1`, charcoal line art drawn on, a yellow marker label, one clean slice) |
| Cut-out bg swaps | An exact cut-out (source pixels plus the matte alpha) over stock backgrounds. The backgrounds push horizontally; scaled ones use xPercent ±115 |
| Full-screen screens | **Sharp 3D tilt planes** from the PDFs' **embedded** images (`scripts/pdf_tilt.py`). `transformPerspective` is 1700–1800, rotY ±7–11°, rotX 3–7°, with a slow drift. Clear `filter` after the blur-in, or the plane stays soft. In 9:16, planes fill the height and glide across the content column |
| Proof | A grid of module thumbnails zooms out from module 1, with a yellow ring on the first and last. Then the grid blurs and **real student results** (cropped chat recordings, names blurred) rise on the keyword |
| Claim badge | A glass badge visible the whole video, from 0.27 s to the end card: "**100%** DIEDIT OLEH CLAUDE / Claude Opus 5.5 · High · Siap NN minit". Bottom-left in 16:9, top-centre (top 96) in 9:16. Only use the user's own claim text |
| End card | The last frame, blurred 24 px, then the real logo pops in and the title blurs in. **No CTA button** unless the user asks |
| Camera | 16:9: slow pushes (1.0 → 1.07 in the hook, 1.15 at the end). 9:16: **calm** (sine only, half the zoom range, no snaps); the presenter steps left/right on headline beats |
| Footage | The grade is never touched. Tag everything BT.709 and render `--sdr`. 9:16 from 1080p source = lanczos ×1.7778 strip (1848×1920), plus light unsharp |
| Audio | Voice untouched. The supplied song at original tempo, **voice LUFS − 20**, a 0.3 s ramp, lifted ×2.2 on the end card. Every SFX is synthesised with its own seed (no repeats): click/double-click, ting (rising pitches), pop, paper, keyboard, riser, thud, sparkle, shutter, blip, tick-roll, plus whoosh-impact on the chapter cards **only**. Mix to −14 LUFS with a limiter |

## Workflow

1. **Plan before rendering.** Transcribe the take and refine word starts from the energy envelope (`times.py`; Whisper drifts 0.2–0.3 s). Write `PLAN.md` as a beat table (time | words | visual | SFX) and list the assets needed. Wait for approval ("jangan render apa-apa, bagi plan dulu").
2. **Clean start.** If the user names the first line, count syllable nuclei in the 100–900 Hz band at 10 ms resolution, and cut in the closure **before** the first syllable. Whisper boundaries run early (v1 kept the "-o" of the previous word). Trimming after render (`finish.sh` `TRIM=`) keeps composition times unchanged.
3. **Assets.** Run `prep16.sh` (frame-exact A-roll, `voice.wav`, exact cut-out, last frame). Make tilt planes with `pdf_tilt.py`. Stage slide videos muted, cropped and short. Crop result recordings and blur names.
4. **Build 16:9.** Edit `build.py` (`T` overrides, `CARD`, the beat blocks), then run `audio.py` (`SONG=… python3`, the cue list).
5. **Check.** Run `npx hyperframes check` (0 errors). Snapshot **every beat**. Look for: text over the face or the print, white text on cream cards (give it a dark backing), bg edges peeking in, last grid rows not centred.
6. **Render** with `finish.sh` (delivery, `--sdr`, trim). Verify with ffprobe (bt709), `ebur128` ≈ −14 LUFS, and a Whisper check of the opening words. **Wait for 16:9 approval before 9:16.**
7. **9:16.**
   1. If the user asks for the RAW / un-swapped take, check that it is frame-aligned (audio cross-correlation lag 0). Then run `prep9.sh` with `SRC9=…`; it builds new strips and a fresh matte.
   2. Run `build9.py` (face constants `AX/PX/FACE_*`, `DOWN`, text tops follow the face) and `finish9.sh`.
   3. Snapshot every beat: badge clear of tilt headlines, triptych tags at the card bottom, the pile beat stepping away from the face.

## Known gotchas

- HyperFrames: every `<video>` needs an id. Use `immediateRender:false` on fromTo tweens. Hide late elements with `gsap.set` at t = 0. Duplicate ids silently break tweens.
- Mask on the A-roll: in 9:16 the strip **is** the masked box, so the mask moves with it. Never mask a parent smaller than its video.
- `sips` rasterises PDFs soft; use the embedded image. A tilt plane that keeps a `filter` after its blur-in renders soft.
- A second root HTML with `data-composition-id` in the project makes `check` fail (duplicate audio). Move backups out.
- Presenters drift inside long takes. Re-check face x per beat before side-steps (the 9:16 pile beat needed −300).
- Claims: "Siap NN minit" and "Opus 5.5 · High" are the user's statements. Report the real build time honestly alongside.
- Write with `/usr/bin/python3` (it has cv2, numpy, scipy, pypdf). Homebrew `python3` lacks PIL/cv2.
