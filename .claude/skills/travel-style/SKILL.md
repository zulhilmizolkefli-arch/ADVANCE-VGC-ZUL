  "Travel Style": a locked 9:16 editing style for travel-lifestyle and holiday-package ads (first built for a travel
  agency). Raw phone takes are cleaned (the off-camera prompter voice and every silent gap cut out, lines in
  script order), then the presenter is cut out pixel-exact over real travel footage. Pop-out palette: navy + gold. Two
  colour acts (gold destination titles, then a white-on-navy brand act). Condensed serif place titles, a big Poppins
  hero word plus a Sacramento script behind the head, captions with royal-yellow keywords, vertical "lift"
  transitions, a real-data vector map with a flight and a ground trail, and the logo only at the end over blurred
  real footage. Use whenever someone says "Travel Style", "style travel", "travel lifestyle", "iklan pakej
  percutian", or asks for a 9:16 travel or holiday-package ad from talking-head takes and B-roll, even without naming
  the style. Built with HyperFrames; renders the real MP4.
compatibility: >-
  Claude Code (shell access). Needs ffmpeg/ffprobe, Python 3, Node 18+ (npx hyperframes@0.8.149), and whisper-cli or
  `npx hyperframes transcribe` for Malay transcription. The cut-out uses `hyperframes remove-background` (CoreML on
  Apple silicon, CPU elsewhere, slower).

# Travel Style

`template/` holds a finished, approved build. Its files:
- `index.html`;
- `assets/js/anim.js` (all timing);
- `captions.js`;
- `routemap.js` (the baked map);
- the fonts and a placeholder logo.

Its worked example is a holiday-package ad: KLIA → Abu Dhabi flight, then an Abu Dhabi → Dubai trail. Treat it as a worked example. Copy it, swap the media, and edit its data (scene times, titles, captions, map points); don't rewrite it from scratch. Commands, the beat map and the gotchas are in `references/pipeline.md`. Read it before building.

Each new video keeps the identity below and adds **one signature moment of its own** that fits its story. In the example, that moment is the flight map. Repeating the same hero moment in every ad makes the series feel templated.

## Locked identity

| Layer | Rule |
|---|---|
| Inputs | Phone talking-head takes of the presenter. These are often several short WhatsApp or iPhone clips, sometimes one long take, and each starts with an **off-camera voice reading the line first** ("suara campak skrip"). Portrait travel B-roll (iPhone, usually 1584×2816). The brand's own logo, which replaces `template/assets/img/brand-logo.png`. Probe everything: rotation metadata, HDR (iPhone HLG must be tone-mapped to SDR with Apple `avconvert -p Preset1920x1080`), loudness and L/R polarity. |
| Edit | Keep only the talent's delivery. Cut the prompter cue at the head of each take, squeeze inner silences to ~0.14 s and line gaps to ~0.2 s, and never speed speech up. Order lines by **the script's logic**, not by file names. Cut on loudness-envelope dips, because Whisper word times drift 0.2–0.3 s. |
| Format | 1080×1920, 30 fps, SDR BT.709, rendered with `--sdr`. |
| Palette | Navy `#0a1a4f` / deep `#071238`, brand gold `#ffc72c` (highlight `#ffe07a`), white, and royal yellow `#fada5e` for caption keywords. Bright, high-contrast and premium: gold never sits on gold without a navy edge. Swap the gold for the student's brand colour if asked. |
| Two colour acts | **Destination act** (the emotional opening, up to the line that names the brand): place titles in brand gold with an 8 px navy stroke and a 7 px navy drop, hero words white with a soft navy glow, script in pale gold. **Brand act** (from the exact words that name the brand): text white with a 10 px navy stroke, a hard navy drop and a navy halo, with accents (e.g. "&", "WhatsApp") in brand gold. Captions switch to the navy stroke in the brand act. |
| Captions | Poppins 800, 66 px, 2–4 words, at y ≈ 1500, white with a 9 px dark stroke and a hard drop shadow. One keyword per chunk in royal yellow. Leave out words a big title already shows. Fix Whisper's Malay spellings before they go on screen. |
| Place titles (front) | Noto Serif Display condensed (`wdth` 62.5, `wght` 800), caps, 170–210 px, at y ≈ 150–190. One or two lines rise out of a mask with a stagger, under an italic Poppins 700 kicker. Use them on full-frame B-roll and for the brand line. |
| Hero words (behind the head) | Poppins 800 at 120–250 px (size each word so it fits inside 1080 px), letter-spacing −0.035em. A Sacramento script (128 px, −7°) writes on left→right over its top-left. Place it so the presenter's hair overlaps only the bottom ~15 % of the letters. At most one per sentence: the hook word, the emotion word or the key benefit. |
| Transitions | **Lift** only. The incoming layer rises from below (yPercent 100→0, blur 14→0, 0.7 s `power3.inOut`) while the outgoing one drifts up 24 % with an 8 px blur. A full-frame cutaway leaves by lifting off upward (yPercent 0→−100) to reveal the next scene. No wipes, flashes, dims or shape transitions. |
| Presenter | A pixel-exact cut-out: the ML matte alphamerged with the source YUV, BT.709. **Standing** shots go over real footage or the map. **Seated** shots keep their own background, because the cut-out sits on its own frame and chairs never float; full-frame cutaways cover them. Check every matte for leaks from printed backdrops behind the head. If a shot leaks, use its original frame for that shot. Never tint, dim or re-grade the presenter. |
| Camera | Calm: sine glides of ≤ 1.2 s between 1.0 and 1.08. The takes are often 576p, so don't push further. Seated own-background shots move the cut-out and its background together. During the map the presenter steps down ~210 px so the route sits above the head. |
| Footage | Never grade, scrim, vignette or dim B-roll. Blur is the only treatment (map background, end card). Add a slow linear drift (scale 1.0→1.08) while a clip is visible. Don't label footage with a place name unless the location is confirmed. |
| Map (signature) | Real data only: Natural Earth 10m countries and OpenStreetMap-verified coordinates. `scripts/route_map.py` checks that every point sits inside its country. Navy sea and land, with the origin and destination countries in brand gold and a white edge. The sequence: overview → the plane flies origin → pin A along a gold arc → log zoom in → pin A (script "hari pertama") → navy trail via a midpoint → pin B (script "seterusnya"). Place it on the line that names the places, for 5–8 s. |
| End | The logo appears **only at the end**. The last shot lifts off, the real footage behind it blurs to 16 px, the logo rises with a gold light sweep, then the script tagline and the contact line appear ("WhatsApp" in royal yellow). |
| Audio | Voice cleaned (highpass, light denoise, 2.5:1 compression, loudnorm) to −16 LUFS. An original soft ambient pad (no vocals) sits ~20 dB under the voice, swells after the last word, and has one soft bell on the logo. SFX are soft and synthesised: lift whoosh, title pops, a jet under the flight and air on the zoom. |

## Workflow

1. **Probe and plan.**
   1. Probe every file.
   2. Transcribe each take in Malay. Transcribe the first 2–3 s of each take separately (boosted) to hear the prompter cue.
   3. Make contact sheets of the takes and the B-roll.
   4. Send the student a beat table (time, VO line, background, graphic) with the open questions: line order, any place names in the B-roll, music preference, anything unclear in the VO.
   5. Don't put prices or claims on screen that the VO doesn't say.
2. **Clean the A-roll.**
   1. Run `scripts/cutlist.py` (`clips.json` in script order), then `scripts/render_aroll.py`. This gives `aroll_cut.mp4` (1080×1920, 30 fps) and `voice.wav` (−16 LUFS).
   2. Re-transcribe `voice.wav` with word times. It must contain no prompter words, and these word times drive caption and title timing.
3. **Project.**
   1. Copy `template/` to a new project folder.
   2. Run `bash scripts/media.sh cutout aroll_cut.mp4`.
   3. Cut backgrounds with `media.sh clip`: the B-roll, plus slices of `aroll_cut.mp4` for seated own-background shots.
   4. Use `media.sh still` for the map background.
4. **Map** (if the story names the route).
   1. Download Natural Earth 10m countries.
   2. Edit `PTS` in `scripts/route_map.py` (origin, pin A, via, pin B, each with its ISO A3 code). Run it into `assets/js/routemap.js`; every point must print `inside=True`.
   3. Change the pin and country labels in `index.html`.
5. **Audio.**
   1. Run `scripts/music.py` (pad, plus the bell at the logo time).
   2. Run `media.sh bed`, then `media.sh sfx`.
   3. Run `scripts/mix_sfx.py` with an events list that matches your lifts, titles, pins and map.
   4. Keep the voice at least 20 dB above the music.
6. **Composition.** Edit `index.html` (layers, titles, media `data-start` / `data-duration`), `assets/js/anim.js` (backgrounds, cutaways, camera glides, map times, titles, end) and `captions.js`. Keep the layer order described in the pipeline reference.
7. **Check.**
   1. Run `npx --yes hyperframes@0.8.149 lint`.
   2. Snapshot every title, cutaway and map beat, and the end.
   3. Look for: text overflowing 1080 px, hero words hidden by the head, matte leaks, captions colliding with titles, and seated cut-outs floating.
8. **Render.**
   1. Use `render --quality looks --fps 30 --sdr` for the draft.
   2. Verify with ffprobe (yuv420p, bt709) and ebur128 (≈ −15 / −16 LUFS).
   3. Crop a face from the render and compare it with `aroll_cut.mp4`.
   4. Do the delivery render after the student approves.
