  "Journey Map Hook": a locked editing style for travel / destination ads with a talking-head presenter on a cut-out
  (first built for a travel client's Switzerland ad, Oct 2026). A short cinematic 3D terrain-map hook (satellite relief,
  country filled in the brand colour with a neon border, labelled cities, fly-in to the featured landmark), then real
  footage and stills behind the presenter, cinematic gradient + script place titles (never boxes), clean slide-left
  transitions, live zoom/dolly on the presenter driven by voice energy, cleaned voice and low ducked music. 16:9 first,
  then a purpose-built 9:16. Use whenever the user says "Journey Map Hook", "map hook", "style peta", "intro peta 3D", or asks for a destination/travel ad that opens on a 3D map, even without naming it. Built
  with HyperFrames (HTML + GSAP + Three.js); renders the real MP4.

# Journey Map Hook

First built for "Ramai Ingat Amek Gambar Je" (Switzerland, Oct 2026). Locked identity below; destination, copy and shot
choices change per video. Pipeline details and numbers: `references/pipeline.md`. Read it before building.

## Locked identity

| Layer | Rule |
|---|---|
| Structure | 0–1.5 s presenter full-frame → **map hook only ~5–10 s** (national overview → fly-in to the landmark) → everything after is **real footage/stills** behind the presenter → CTA over real footage with logo + the brand's website |
| Map | Real data only: AWS Terrarium DEM + NASA Blue Marble + Natural Earth lakes + **official national boundary** (swisstopo for Switzerland; use the country's official source elsewhere) + verified city coordinates. Country fill `#ff661f`, neon border per neighbour (FR cyan, DE yellow, IT green, AT pink), dark terrain, white city dots, orange landmark pin. Labels typed by us, never AI text |
| Titles | Gradient (orange→white) Montserrat 900 caps + handwritten script (Mrs Saint Delafield) underneath, over a dark scrim. **No purple boxes / HUD panels / pills** ("murah"). Numbers and checklists are plain typography |
| Transitions | **Slide-left only** (incoming from right, outgoing drifts left slower with blur + dim). No swipe bars, iris, wipes, flashes. Optional soft cross-fade at the very end |
| Presenter | Green-screen cutout keyed to alpha (never re-grade; user already retouched). Full ↔ PiP (bottom-left, white outline + orange glow). Camera alive: slow push, snap punch-ins on emphasis words, pull-outs on pauses, ≤ ~1.3×. Sync to voice energy, not Whisper times |
| Captions | Montserrat 900 caps, 2–3 words, white with `#14091f` stroke, keyword in `#ff661f`. Mark guessed words `?` in `captions.js`; leave unclear parts (prices) uncaptioned until the user confirms |
| Frame | **No vignette / dark edges** anywhere (map, b-roll, talk). Only very light top/bottom scrims (~25%) for text legibility |
| Brand | the brand's website: orange `#ff661f`, purple `#240064/#352540/#23172f`, lilac `#bba9ce`, mist `#e8e3ed`; logo `assets/img/brand-logo.svg` (a placeholder: swap in the student's own logo); tagline "Beyond Tourism" |
| Audio | Voice cleaned (see pipeline), −16 LUFS. Music ~20 dB under voice, sidechain-ducked, lowpassed, fades to full length. SFX soft slide whooshes + pops/ticks, ~−30 LUFS. Supplied soundtracks are loud (−11 LUFS): always attenuate |
| Deliverables | 16:9 1920×1080 30 fps first, then 9:16 1080×1920 (presenter native-res at the bottom, map/footage/titles above). Render `--quality delivery` only after approval |

## Workflow

1. Gather: presenter cutout (green screen ok), baked backdrop plate(s), b-roll stills + montage, soundtrack, VO. Probe everything.
2. Transcribe the VO (`npx hyperframes transcribe vo.wav --model small --language ms`), draft captions with `?` marks, compute the VO energy envelope.
3. Key the presenter: `chromakey` + `despill` → VP9 alpha WebM (see pipeline).
4. Bake the map for the destination with `scripts/bake-map.mjs` (edit the PATCHES / POIs / neighbours block at the top of that file for the new country). Run the inside-border check; **geography must pass before any render**.
5. Copy `template/` into a new `npx hyperframes init` project, replace destination data (`akg-config.js` cam/labels, `captions.js`, titles in `index.html`, clip timings in `anim.js`), cut montage clips with ffmpeg.
6. Audio: clean voice, duck/attenuate music, build SFX (`scripts/make-sfx.sh`), then a draft render and review contact sheets.
7. `npx hyperframes lint` → snapshots at transitions → draft render → user approval → delivery render of 16:9, then `scripts/make-9x16.py` and delivery render of 9:16.

## Known gotchas

- `hyperframes check` false-positives `text_not_painted` on gradient text; verify in the render instead.
- Name clash: `VERT` is the vertex shader in `map.js`; use `IS_VERT` for the portrait flag.
- Map labels clip into titles: place neighbour labels with fixed lon/lat (see `map.js`), not run midpoints.
- 1080p montage clips look soft when cover-cropped to 9:16 (~1.8×). Say so; ask for 4K if available.
- Never put a price on screen before the user confirms the script.
