  "Native Viral Styles" — the user's locked style for vertical 9:16 talking-head ads where the presenter commands the
  edit and it obeys: a Claude Code chip types each command, then the effect happens (AI zoom in/out HUD, keyframes
  deleted, power aura, 3D orbit of video cards behind and in front of the presenter, palm orb implode, lightning,
  slot reel, PiP takeover). Two-tier top captions: kicker with one #FFE600 keyword plus a big Anton headline on ~10
  key words, some behind the head (cutout). Camera always alive (pushes, punch-ins). Neutral palette, never
  hacker-green; no white flashes or fades; every SFX synthesized unique. Use whenever the user says "Native Viral
  Styles", "Native Viral", "style Control Zoom", "macam video zoom in zoom out tu", or asks for a viral/native 9:16
  talking-head ad with AI or Claude-interaction effects, cutout captions or "paling ekstrim" HyperFrames motion, even
  without naming the style. Renders the real MP4 with HyperFrames.

# Native Viral Styles

First built for VGC "Control Zoom In/Out" (Oct 2026, 45 s, 9:16). The identity below is locked; the script, beats,
assets and which effect modules appear change per video. Numbers, layer order and code recipes are in
`references/pipeline.md`; the effect modules are in `references/scenes.md`. Read both before building. A working
project lives at `template/` (build script, 11 scene modules, audio generator, Anton font).

## Locked identity

| Layer | Rule |
|---|---|
| Concept | Every effect is "asked for". Where the presenter says a command or describes a capability, a **Claude Code chip** (bottom, y≈1400) types a short BM command in JetBrains Mono, a coral cursor follows, a white status pill shows `✓ …`, then the effect happens on screen. Use it on the 2–4 strongest beats, not everywhere |
| Captions | **Top, two-tier.** Kicker: Inter 900 uppercase ~44 px, white, one keyword `#FFE600`. **Big headline only on ~8–10 key words** (Anton, white, soft shadow, no heavy glow), timed to the spoken word. Other lines are a small 2-line uppercase caption (40/52 px). Captions must follow the speaker's words verbatim |
| Cutout | Some big headlines sit **behind the head** (person matte layer above them). Place them high (top ≈58 px, ≤158 px) so the cap covers only the bottom of the letters, and hide the kicker when they appear. Headlines that land during a big zoom go in front (the face would cover them) |
| Camera | Alive all the time: slow pushes (1.0→1.06–1.15) under build-up lines, snap punch-ins (+0.08–0.2 in 0.08–0.12 s) on keywords, zoom-out punches on "release" words, shake (≤18 px) on impacts. Pivot on the face. Never sit static >2 s |
| Palette | **Not hacker green.** Neutral base: white type, dark frosted glass (`rgba(9,13,18,.68)` + blur 24). Accents: coral `#D97757` (Claude spark/cursor), yellow `#FFE600` (keywords, clocks), blue-white `#6FB1FF` (aura, orb, lightning, rings), red `#FF4D4D` only for ✕/strikes. Brand lime only on the logo and CTA button. Footage grade untouched |
| No fades | The first frame is clean footage: no white flash, no fade-in, no "wake" zoom. No full-screen white/colour flashes anywhere; impacts use shake, rings and particles instead |
| Effects | Pick modules from `references/scenes.md` to match what is said (zoom HUD, keyframe panel, clock, power aura, 3D orbit + palm orb implode, super-power lightning, icon cards, slot reel, motion takeover + PiP, vignette push, CTA with confetti). Any card/panel lives mid or low (y 860–1300), away from the top captions and the face |
| Audio | Voice untouched (−16 to −18 LUFS integrated, TP ≤ −1.5). Supplied music: slowed 0.75×, low-pass 3.8 kHz, ~20–22 dB under the voice, sidechain duck, **drops out on the punchline** and returns for the CTA. SFX: one designed sound per event, every instance synthesized with its own seed/params, **no sample reused** |
| Deliverable | 9:16 1080×1920 30 fps first (`render -q delivery`), then 3:4 / 16:9 re-layouts on request (never a raw crop) |

## Workflow

1. **Analyse**: probe the footage (fps, LUFS, jump cuts), transcribe with `scripts/transcribe_words.py` (large-v3), and make face/hand grids with `scripts/grid_sheet.sh`. Present a beat-by-beat plan table (time | words | visual | technique | SFX) and wait for approval. Ask at most 3 questions (assets for orbit/takeover, output formats, any rhetorical beat to keep plain).
2. **Set up**: `npx hyperframes init <dir>/hf --non-interactive --example=blank --skill=general-video`, copy `template/scripts` → `<dir>/scripts`, copy footage and assets into `hf/assets/`, and copy `template/assets/fonts/anton-400.woff2` → `hf/assets/fonts/`.
3. **Matte** the presenter in the background as early as possible (`npx hyperframes remove-background main.mov -o build/matte.webm --quality best`; copy the weights from `~/.u2net/` if they're not cached), then re-encode to `hf/assets/person.webm` (VP9 alpha, crf 26). Check alpha stills at 4–5 times.
4. **Edit the config blocks** in `scripts/build.py`: `SC` (which scene modules, start, duration, in-camera or not), `PAIRS` (kicker / headline / times), `KEY` (which pairs get a big headline, `B` behind head or `F` front), `PROMPTS` (chip commands), `CAM` (camera keys), `SHAKES`. Edit the module HTML (coordinates, hand-track keys, words). Edit `EV` in `scripts/audio.py`.
5. Run `python3 scripts/build.py && python3 scripts/audio.py`, then `npx hyperframes check` (fix every ✗), snapshots at each beat, a draft render, and check voice lag (0 ms) and loudness. Then the delivery render, spot-check frames, and send the MP4.

## Known gotchas

- Sub-compositions are concatenated: `build.py` prefixes ids (`scene__id`) and scopes CSS. Dynamic ids built in JS (`"#x"+i`) are **not** rewritten, so keep element arrays instead of ids, or write the prefixed form (`"#keyf__x"+i`).
- A `fromTo` placed later in a timeline renders its from-state at t=0. Use `immediateRender:false` for elements that must be visible earlier.
- Never give an element both a CSS `transform` and a GSAP transform tween; `gsap.set` the initial rotate instead.
- The person matte layer above the headlines must be hidden while 3D orbit cards pass in front of the presenter.
- The top scrim must sit *below* the headline layers, or the headlines look grey.
- `hf-seek` time is global: analytic scenes (orbit, orb, particles) compute from `e.detail.time`.
- Anton needs a local `@font-face`, or `check` fails. Whisper drifts 0.2–0.3 s and mishears slang ("selamba" → "selama"), so flag doubtful words to the user.
