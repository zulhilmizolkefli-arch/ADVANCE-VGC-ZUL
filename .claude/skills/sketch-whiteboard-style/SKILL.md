  "Sketch Whiteboard Style": the user's locked style for faceless hand-drawn whiteboard explainer/ads on a
  voice-over (first built for VGC "Sketch Educators", Oct 2026). Cream paper #f2ede3, charcoal ink, one accent per
  board (blue, red, green, a little purple) with marker-tint highlights. A blue pencil (never a hand) writes and
  draws line-art in sync with the voice. One long sheet: the camera pans while the pencil draws a connecting line
  into the next board. Calm soft fades, song low under the voice, marker-scribble SFX. Renders 9:16, 16:9 and 4:3.
  Use whenever the user says "Sketch Whiteboard", "style whiteboard", "style sketch", "style Sketch
  Educators", "macam video Sketch Educators tu", "lukis tangan", or asks for a hand-drawn / doodle / whiteboard
  explainer, even without naming it. Built with HyperFrames; renders the real MP4.

# Sketch Whiteboard Style

First built for VGC **"Sketch Educators"** (22 Oct 2026): 61.8 s, 15 boards, aimed at cikgu and lecturers, on a supplied VO and a kids-story song.
- v1 copied a Threads reference post: white paper, a cartoon hand, gold icons and boards sliding left. The user said it was too cluttered ("terlampau serabut").
- **v2 is the locked style:** pencil only, calm, continuous, cream and charcoal with accents.

What changes per video and what stays locked:
- **Per video:** the VO, the boards (one board per idea), the drawings and the accent per board.
- **Locked:** the identity below.

Where everything else lives:
- `references/pipeline.md`: the action API, the board catalogue, the landscape layout and the audio recipe.
- `template/hf/index.html`: the exact approved v2 composition (one file, 15 boards). It is a worked example, so replace the board blocks rather than writing from scratch.
- `template/scripts/`: the rest of the build: `events.py`, `make_audio.py`, `build_fmt.py` and `transcribe.py`.
- `references/index_v1_hand_gold.html`: the rejected v1, kept as a reference for what **not** to do.

## Locked identity

| Layer | Rule |
|---|---|
| Paper | Cream `#f2ede3`, with cards in `#fbf8f1` and grey `#6b6a70` for secondary lines. No white paper, no gold |
| Ink | Charcoal `#26262b` for all outlines and text. Strokes are round-capped, 5–7 px |
| Accents | **One accent per board**, chosen from blue `#2d5bff`, red `#f0453a` and green `#14a85a`, with purple `#8b5cf6` only rarely. Marker highlights use the light tint (`#a9c0ff`, `#ffa79f`, `#8fe0b2`, `#cdb9ff`) under the key word |
| Type | Archivo Black uppercase for headlines and key words, and Poppins 700 for sentence titles. Write English words in their English spelling, for example "Group" and not "Grup" |
| Tool | A **blue pencil only**, never a hand. It glides on eased paths (smootherstep), follows every `write`/`draw` stroke, rests low-right when idle (`REST`) and never pops in or out mid-video |
| Drawing | Line-art icons (phone, laptop, slides, chat bubble, vault, play button and so on) are drawn stroke by stroke with dash-offset. Fills wash in **behind** the pencil. Text writes left to right through a clip reveal |
| Continuity | One long sheet, with board `i` at `x = i × W`. Between boards the camera pans (sine in-out) while the pencil draws **one connecting line** from the last stroke of the board into the first stroke of the next. The line fades 0.7 s after it arrives. No slide-offs, no cuts |
| Motion | Calm: soft fades and eased glides. **No** bouncy pops, twinkles, sparkles or shakes. `pop()` is a soft scale-fade with no overshoot |
| Sync | Each board starts on its sentence. Stroke times come from the voice envelope, not raw Whisper times (Whisper drifts 0.2–0.3 s). Whisper also invents words: "Bantu" at 22.6 and "Dah." at 50.92 were hallucinations, "cloud" was Claude and "prom" was prompt |
| End | The real VGC logo is drawn or popped onto the last board, with a short tracked CTA line. No button unless asked |
| Audio | Voice with gain only (+6 dB in the first build). The song is slowed to 0.75×, low-passed at 3.8 kHz, about **20–22 dB under the voice** and ducked a further 4 dB. SFX are synthesised and soft: a marker scribble under every pen stroke (quieter for drawings), small pops for stickers and a paper swish on each pan. A soft limiter at −1 dBFS and a 1 s fade-out |

## Workflow

1. **Transcribe:** `/usr/bin/python3 scripts/transcribe.py hf/assets/vo_src.wav scripts/words_raw.json`. Fix the Whisper errors by hand.
2. **Plan boards:** one board per sentence or idea. For each, write the time its first stroke starts, its accent, its title and its drawing. Keep the boards sparse: one title, one drawing, at most two short lines of copy.
3. **Build:**
   1. Copy `template/hf` and `template/scripts` into the project.
   2. Put `vo_src.wav`, `song_src.wav` (48 kHz stereo) and `brand_logo.png` in `hf/assets/`.
   3. Edit `BOARDS` (`[id, startTime, accent]`), `DUR`, and each board's `add()` markup and action calls.
4. **Audio:** run `python3 scripts/events.py` (it reads the pen, pop and push times from `index.html`), then `python3 scripts/make_audio.py`.
5. **Check:** run `npx hyperframes lint` and `check`, then snapshot every board and every pan midpoint. Look for:
   - a pencil tip that does not sit on the stroke being drawn;
   - text that runs past the board;
   - a first frame that is blank.
6. **Render 9:16:** `cd hf && npx hyperframes render --quality delivery --fps 30 -o ../<Name>_9x16.mp4`.
7. **Landscape (when asked):** `python3 scripts/build_fmt.py` writes `hf169/` (1920×1080) and `hf43/` (1440×1080) from the 9:16 source. Per board, `LAYOUT` puts the title on top, the art on the left and the copy on the right, with `fit()` sizing by getBBox. Render each one, and edit only `hf/index.html`.

## Break pattern (must)

Don't repeat the previous video's drawings or board order. Keep the identity, and draw new metaphors for every script. See the `feedback-break-pattern-across-videos` memory.

## Known gotchas

- **Build synchronously.** Building inside `document.fonts.ready` left the first frame of each snapshot or render worker blank. Use `clipPathUnits="objectBoundingBox"` for text reveals, and read `getBBox()` lazily per frame.
- Generated ids are `${id}_svg` and `${id}_defs`. Never give an element an id like `b7s` or `b4d`, because it clashes with board-derived ids.
- Round-cap strokes show a dot before the dash-draw starts. Also fade `strokeOpacity` in at the start of the draw.
- The pencil reads positions through `getCTM`, so groups that `LAYOUT` moves stay in sync in the landscape formats.
- Run Python with `/usr/bin/python3`.
